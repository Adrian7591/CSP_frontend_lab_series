# Guided Practice — Lab 1.1 (Intro)

1) Predict the output: 55 because you have a number and a string 
```js
let x = 5;
let y = "5";
console.log(x + y);
```
Explain why that output occurs.

let a ="7";
let b = "3";
console.log (Number (a) + Number (b))

2) Fix the bug so each line logs a number, not a string:
```js
let a = "7";
let b = "3";
console.log(a + b);
```
